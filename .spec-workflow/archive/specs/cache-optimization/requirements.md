# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the cache optimization improvements outlined in improvement.md. The initiative focuses on optimizing the existing Hazelcast-based caching infrastructure to improve performance, reliability, and maintainability across the Spring Modulith bookstore application. Key improvements include configuring lazy loading for MapStore, optimizing health checks to avoid triggering MapStore operations, introducing index caches for efficient lookups, implementing batch repository queries, and strengthening module boundaries.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This cache optimization effort directly supports the product vision by:

- **Production Readiness**: Enhancing enterprise-grade performance and reliability through optimized caching strategies
- **Technical Excellence**: Demonstrating best practices for distributed caching in modular monolith architectures
- **Educational Value**: Providing reference implementation for cache optimization patterns in Spring Modulith applications
- **Scalability Goals**: Supporting horizontal scaling requirements through improved cache performance and reduced database load

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hazelcast Configuration Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized Hazelcast configuration to prevent early database loading and improve application startup time, so that the system starts faster and more reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN MapStore SHALL use lazy initial load mode to avoid early `loadAllKeys()` operations
2. WHEN MapStore components are configured THEN they SHALL use consistent `@SpringAware` + `SpringManagedContext` wiring pattern across all modules
3. WHEN inventory cache is configured THEN TTL SHALL be externalized through CacheProperties instead of hardcoded 1800 seconds

### Requirement 2: Health Check Optimization

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want health checks that don't trigger unnecessary database operations, so that monitoring doesn't impact system performance or cause false alarms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks are performed THEN system SHALL use `getLocalMapStats().getOwnedEntryCount()` instead of `size()` for orders, products, and inventory caches
2. WHEN basic operations test is executed THEN it SHALL be configurable as read-only or disabled to avoid write operations during health checks
3. WHEN aggregate statistics are calculated THEN they SHALL use local statistics to avoid triggering MapStore operations

### Requirement 3: Cache API and Data Model Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient cache lookup mechanisms that avoid full table scans, so that product code-based searches perform optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for inventory by product code THEN system SHALL use index cache `IMap<String, Long> inventoryByProductCode` (key: productCode, value: inventoryId) instead of `values()` scan
2. WHEN cache entries are written or updated THEN system SHALL maintain bidirectional cache consistency between main cache and index cache
3. WHEN multiple entities need to be loaded THEN system SHALL support batch queries through `ProductRepository#findByCodeIn()` and `OrderRepository#findByOrderNumberIn()` methods

### Requirement 4: Spring Modulith Boundary Strengthening

**User Story:** As an architect, I want clearly defined module boundaries with explicit public APIs, so that the system maintains proper modularity and prevents boundary violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are defined THEN each SHALL have `package-info.java` with `@ApplicationModule` annotation
2. WHEN cross-module access is required THEN it SHALL only occur through `@NamedInterface` explicitly marked public APIs
3. WHEN dependency relationships exist THEN they SHALL maintain the pattern of orders depending on catalog and common cache modules

### Requirement 5: Build and CI Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent build environments across local development and CI/CD, so that builds are reproducible and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL use Java 21 consistently with local development (pom.xml java.version=21)
2. WHEN Liquibase runs THEN connection information SHALL be externalized through Maven profiles or environment variables instead of hardcoded in pom.xml

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Logging Improvements

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want appropriate logging levels that reduce noise while maintaining visibility into actual problems, so that I can focus on real issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MapStore encounters repository unavailability during startup THEN messages SHALL be logged at DEBUG level instead of WARN/ERROR
2. WHEN CacheErrorHandler triggers THEN thresholds for FAILURE_THRESHOLD and recovery time SHALL be configurable by environment
3. WHEN unexpected exceptions occur in cache operations THEN they SHALL still be logged at WARN/ERROR levels for proper alerting

### Requirement 7: Test Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test validation to ensure that all changes maintain system integrity and reliability, so that modifications don't introduce regressions or break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any cache optimization change is implemented THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass without failures or errors
2. WHEN new cache functionality is added THEN corresponding unit tests and integration tests SHALL be created and pass
3. WHEN MapStore or cache configuration changes are made THEN cache-specific integration tests SHALL verify correct behavior
4. WHEN module boundary changes are implemented THEN ModularityTests SHALL continue to pass and validate proper boundaries
5. WHEN performance optimizations are applied THEN existing performance-sensitive tests SHALL maintain or improve their execution times

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each cache service should manage only its specific domain cache
- **Modular Design**: Cache components should be isolated within their respective modules (catalog, orders, inventory)
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between cache modules, maintain clear boundaries
- **Clear Interfaces**: Public cache APIs should be well-defined and documented through @NamedInterface

### Performance
- **Startup Time**: Lazy MapStore initialization should reduce application startup time by avoiding early database scans
- **Query Performance**: Index caches should eliminate O(n) `values()` scans in favor of O(1) key-based lookups
- **Batch Operations**: Repository batch queries should reduce database round trips for multi-entity operations
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Health monitoring should maintain >90% accuracy without triggering expensive operations

### Security
- **Data Isolation**: Each module's cache should only access its own domain data
- **Configuration Security**: Externalized configuration should support secure credential management
- **Logging Security**: Log messages should not expose sensitive data or internal system details

### Reliability
- **Circuit Breaker**: CacheErrorHandler should provide configurable fault tolerance with environment-specific thresholds
- **Graceful Degradation**: Cache failures should not prevent core application functionality
- **Consistent State**: Bidirectional cache maintenance should ensure data consistency between main and index caches
- **Startup Resilience**: Lazy loading should prevent startup failures due to database unavailability
- **Test Coverage**: All cache optimization changes must maintain 100% test pass rate and include comprehensive test coverage for new functionality

### Usability
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Cache behavior should be tunable through externalized properties
- **Monitoring Clarity**: Health checks should provide clear status without performance impact
- **Developer Experience**: Module boundaries should be enforced through compilation and clear error messages
- **Operational Visibility**: Logging levels should be appropriate for production operations
