# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for extracting the Orders module from the current Spring modular monolith e-commerce application and transforming it into an independent Spring Modulith project. The extracted module will be placed in a dedicated `orders` directory within the project repository, creating a clear separation from the main monolith application while maintaining all existing functionality.

Based on the analysis of the current project, the Orders module is a well-defined business domain with 33 files including domain logic, web controllers, caching, database migration scripts, and comprehensive tests. The module currently has dependencies on the Catalog module for product validation and publishes events consumed by Inventory and Notifications modules.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This extraction aligns with the modular monolith architecture principles documented in the modulith decomposition guide, supporting:
- **Progressive Decomposition**: Following the Strangler Fig pattern for gradual system evolution
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Maintaining loose coupling through domain events and external messaging
- **Database per Service**: Implementing true data isolation with dedicated database schemas
- **Independent Deployability**: Enabling future microservices evolution while maintaining operational simplicity

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Directory Structure and Project Organization

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the Orders module to be organized in a dedicated directory structure, so that it maintains clear separation from the main monolith while being part of the same repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the extracted module THEN the system SHALL establish an `orders` directory at the repository root level
2. IF the directory structure is created THEN it SHALL be at the same level as the main application (sibling to src directory)
3. WHEN the orders directory is established THEN it SHALL contain its own complete Spring Boot project structure
4. IF the extraction is successful THEN the path SHALL be `/orders/` containing all order module components
5. WHEN organizing the code THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between the monolith and the extracted module

### Requirement 2: Independent Spring Boot Application Creation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the Orders module to be extracted as a standalone Spring Boot application within the orders directory, so that it can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting the Orders module THEN the system SHALL create a new Spring Boot 3.5.5 project with Spring Modulith 1.4.3 in the `orders` directory
2. IF the extraction is complete THEN the new project SHALL include all order-related functionality from the source module
3. WHEN the new application starts THEN it SHALL successfully initialize all order services, repositories, and web controllers
4. IF all components are extracted THEN the new project SHALL maintain the same API contracts and web interfaces
5. WHEN running the application THEN it SHALL support the same REST endpoints (/api/orders/*) and web UI (/orders/*)

### Requirement 3: Database Independence and Migration

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the Orders module to use its own database instance, so that it has complete data ownership and isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated PostgreSQL database for the Orders module
2. IF database migration is required THEN the system SHALL include Liquibase migration scripts (V4 and V5) for orders schema creation
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically create the orders schema with proper sequences and tables
4. IF data migration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to migrate existing order data from the monolith
5. WHEN accessing order data THEN the system SHALL use only its own database connection without cross-database references

### Requirement 4: External API Integration for Product Validation

**User Story:** As a business user, I want orders to continue validating products correctly, so that invalid orders cannot be created even after module extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL validate products by calling an external Catalog API
2. IF the Catalog API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate fallback behavior with circuit breaker pattern
3. WHEN product validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify both product existence and price accuracy
4. IF product validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and HTTP status codes
5. WHEN integrating with external APIs THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and timeout handling

### Requirement 5: Event Publishing and External Integration

**User Story:** As an integration developer, I want the Orders module to publish domain events externally, so that other services can react to order lifecycle changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is created successfully THEN the system SHALL publish OrderCreatedEvent to RabbitMQ
2. IF external event publishing is configured THEN the system SHALL use the BookStoreExchange with routing key "orders.new"
3. WHEN events are published THEN the system SHALL ensure reliable delivery with appropriate error handling
4. IF event publishing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors but not prevent order creation
5. WHEN consuming systems need order events THEN the system SHALL provide consistent event schema and content

### Requirement 6: Caching Infrastructure Migration

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the Orders module to maintain its caching capabilities, so that order retrieval performance remains optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN order caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL implement Hazelcast-based distributed caching
2. IF cache operations fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to database-only operations
3. WHEN orders are created or retrieved THEN the system SHALL use write-through caching patterns
4. IF circuit breaker is triggered THEN the system SHALL bypass cache operations and maintain service availability
5. WHEN cache configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL support all existing cache properties and behaviors

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing Suite Migration

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all existing tests to be migrated and continue passing, so that the extracted module maintains the same quality and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test migration is complete THEN the system SHALL include all 5 test classes from the original module
2. IF integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL use TestContainers for PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ
3. WHEN cache-related tests execute THEN the system SHALL validate both cache functionality and fallback behavior
4. IF web controller tests run THEN the system SHALL verify REST API endpoints and web UI functionality
5. WHEN all tests are executed THEN the system SHALL achieve the same test coverage as the original module

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The extracted application should focus solely on order management domain
- **Modular Design**: Maintain clear separation between domain, infrastructure, and web layers
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize external dependencies and implement proper abstraction layers
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts for external API integrations and event publishing
- **Directory Isolation**: The orders module must be completely isolated in its own `/orders` directory at the repository root
- **Independent Build**: The extracted module must have its own pom.xml and be buildable independently from the main monolith

### Performance
- Order creation operations must complete within 500ms under normal load
- Order retrieval with caching must respond within 50ms for cached items
- The system must support 100+ concurrent users with sub-second response times
- Cache operations must not impact core business operations if they fail

### Security
- All external API calls must use secure communication protocols (HTTPS)
- Database connections must use encrypted connections and proper credential management
- Event publishing must include authentication and secure message transport
- Web endpoints must maintain existing security patterns and CORS policies

### Reliability
- The system must achieve 99.9% uptime with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Database transactions must maintain ACID properties with proper rollback capabilities
- Event publishing must be resilient to temporary messaging infrastructure failures
- Cache failures must not affect core order processing functionality

### Usability
- The web interface must maintain identical user experience and functionality
- REST API contracts must remain unchanged to ensure client compatibility
- Error messages must be clear and actionable for both API consumers and web users
- Administrative operations must remain accessible through Spring Actuator endpoints
