# Tasks Document

## Task Overview

This document breaks down the Hazelcast Cache Integration implementation into atomic, executable tasks. Each task is designed to be completed by an AI agent in 15-30 minutes, touching 1-3 related files maximum, with a single testable outcome.

## Steering Document Compliance

- **Tech Standards**: All tasks follow Spring Boot auto-configuration patterns and Spring Modulith boundaries
- **Structure Conventions**: Tasks respect existing package structure with cache components in orders module
- **Architecture Principles**: Tasks maintain event-driven architecture and module isolation

## Atomic Task Requirements

Each task follows these criteria:
- **File Scope**: 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: 15-30 minutes for experienced developer
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching
- **Specific Files**: Exact files to create/modify specified

## Task Format Guidelines

Tasks use checkbox format with:
- Numbered sequence for logical implementation order
- Specific file paths for all modifications
- Clear purpose statement
- Leverage information from existing codebase
- Requirements traceability
- AI-friendly prompts with role, task, restrictions, success criteria

<!-- AI Instructions: For each task, generate a _Prompt field with structured AI guidance following this format:
_Prompt: Role: [specialized developer role] | Task: [clear task description with context references] | Restrictions: [what not to do, constraints] | Success: [specific completion criteria]_
This helps provide better AI agent guidance beyond simple "work on this task" prompts. -->
