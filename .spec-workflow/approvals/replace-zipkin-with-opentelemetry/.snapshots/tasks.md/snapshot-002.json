All changes are declarative (Maven dependencies, application properties, Docker Compose), requiring zero application code modifications. The migration maintains existing Spring Modulith observability features while upgrading to OpenTelemetry protocol with gRPC transport.\n\n## Steering Document Compliance\n\n**Technical Standards (tech.md)**:\n- Maintains Spring Boot 3.5.5 + Spring Modulith 1.4.3 compatibility\n- Uses Maven dependency management for version control\n- Follows Spring Boot property configuration patterns\n- Leverages Docker Compose for local development\n\n**Project Structure (structure.md)**:\n- Dependencies managed in `pom.xml` and `orders/pom.xml`\n- Runtime configuration in `src/main/resources/application.properties`\n- Infrastructure defined in `compose.yml`\n- Documentation updated in `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`\n\n## Atomic Task Requirements\n\n**Each task meets these criteria for optimal execution**:\n- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum\n- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes\n- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task\n- **Specific Files**: Exact file paths to create/modify\n- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Phase 1: Maven Dependency Updates\n\n- [x] 1.
